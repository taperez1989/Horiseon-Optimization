# Horiseon-Optimization

User story: As a student I need to work through the provided starter code and optimize the code for the search engines to make the website more accessible for the users. I needed to modify the code so that it follows the basic HTML sturcture as well as insuring the elements follow a logical structure. Once that is completed, I needed to modify the css file and remove any redundancies in code. Afterwards I needed to succesfully deploy the website.
